# Java Advanced Calculator
> A calculator created as my project for the Java introductory course in the British University in Dubai.

> Java was used in this project.

> The calculator is entirely operated on the terminal.

> The program is comprised of one file.

> The calculator has 5 modes which are the Basic Calculator, the Statistical Calculator, the Matrix Calculator, the Geometeric Calculator, and the Mini Games.

> In total, there are 30 operations that can be preformed.

> An issue with this project is that it does not contain any comments however the code is readable enought to be utilized.

> I suggest running the code and exploaring its capabilities because even though it is such a small project it still has many impressive capabilities like backtracking and the ability to process matrices all in the terminal.

> Enjoy :)
